********Lace's Total File Converter!*******

Hi!

This is a program I wrote in a frenzied Adderall induced craze over the course of about 10 hours.
It should be pretty intuitive to use, but here's a quick rundown just in case:


How to Use?! (••) ( ••)>⌐■-■ (⌐■_■)

    Select Input Files
    Click the "Input Files" button and choose the files you want to convert.

    Select an Output Folder
    Click the "Output Folder" button to select where you'd like your converted files to be saved.

    Choose an Output Format
    Use the "Output Format" dropdown menu to pick the file format you'd like to convert your files to.

    (There are Input and Output folders provided for you to use, but you can do whatever you want lol)


Please Note:
If you attempt to convert an audio file into a video format, the program might punish you because that's very naughty. ಠ_ಠ

    Start the Conversion
    Once you've set everything up, hit the "CONVERT" button and wait a few seconds while it does its thing.

Alsoo GPU Encoding!!!!! ٩(͡๏̯͡๏)۶

By default, the "GPU Encode" checkbox is enabled, which means the program will use your NVIDIA GPU to encode much faster than regular CPU encoding.

However...
This feature requires an NVIDIA GPU that supports NVENC encoding, so make sure you have the right hardware.
If you don't, the program will default to the much slower CPU encoding. (¬_¬)



DOWNLOAD YOUTUBE VIDEOS OMG AAAAA (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

No need for shady websites or expensive programs anymore!
This program includes a free, locally-driven YouTube video downloader, so you can:

    Paste a YouTube link into the input box.
    Select an output folder.
    Click the "Download" button.

The program will download the video in the highest quality available as an MP4.
Enjoy! (งツ)ว

hehe just a silly little converter to make your life easier and by yours I mean mine but also yours.

Have fun, get up, get down, slam, jam.! (ノ◕ヮ◕)ノ*:・゚✧
